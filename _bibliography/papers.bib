  abstract = {Food choice is an important driver of speciation and invasion of novel ecological niches. However, we know little about the mechanisms leading to changes in dietary preference. Here, we use the three closely-related species Drosophila sechellia, D. simulans and D. melanogaster to study taste circuit and food choice evolution. D. sechellia, a host specialist, feeds exclusively on a single fruit (Morinda citrifolia, noni) - the latter two are generalists living on various substrates. Using quantitative feeding assays, we recapitulate the preference for noni in D. sechellia and detect conserved sweet but altered bitter sensitivity via calcium imaging in peripheral taste neurons. Noni surprisingly activates bitter sensing neurons more strongly in D. sechellia due to a small deletion in one single gustatory receptor. Using volumetric calcium imaging in the ventral brain, we show that instead of peripheral physiology, species-specific processing of noni and sugar signals in sensorimotor circuits recapitulates differences in dietary preference. Our data support that peripheral receptor changes alone cannot explain altered food choice but rather modifications in how sensory information is transformed into feeding motor commands.}

Both the program and the data set are freely accessible and downloadable on the Internet (http://neuro.uni-konstanz.de/DoOR). The procedure can be adapted to other species, thus creating a family of "olfactomes" in the near future. Drosophila melanogaster was chosen because of all species this one is closest to having the complete olfactome characterized, with the highest number of deorphanized receptors available. The database guarantees long-term stability (by offering time-stamped, downloadable versions), up-to-date accuracy (by including new data sets as soon as they are published), and portability (for other species). We hope that this comprehensive repository of odor response profiles will be useful to the olfactory community and to computational neuroscientists alike.}

  abstract = {Foraging animals must balance the costs of exploring their surroundings with the potential benefits of finding nutritional resources. Each time an animal encounters a food source it must decide whether to initiate feeding or continue searching for potentially better options. Experimental evidence and patch foraging models predict that this decision depends on both nutritional state and the density of available resources in the environment. How the brain integrates such internal and external states to adapt the so-called exploration-exploitation trade-off remains poorly understood. We use video-based tracking to show that Drosophila regulates the decision to engage with food patches based on nutritional state and travel time between food patches, the latter being a measure of food patch density in the environment. To uncover the neuronal basis of this decision process, we performed a neurogenetic silencing screen of more than 400 genetic driver lines with sparse expression patterns in the fly brain. We identified a population of neurons in the central complex that acts as a key regulator of the decision to engage with a food patch. We show that manipulating the activity of these neurons alters the probability to engage, that their activity is modulated by the protein state of the animal, and that silencing these neurons perturbs the ability of the animal to adjust foraging decisions to the fly's travel time between food patches. Taken together, our results reveal a neuronal substrate that integrates nutritional state and patch density information to control a specific foraging decision, and therefore provide an important step towards a mechanistic explanation of the cognitive computations that resolve complex cost-benefit trade-offs.},

  abstract = {Most odors in natural environments are mixtures of several compounds. Perceptually, these can blend into a new "perfume," or some components may dominate as elements of the mixture. In order to understand such mixture interactions, it is necessary to study the events at the olfactory periphery, down to the level of single-odorant receptor cells. Does a strong ligand present at a low concentration outweigh the effect of weak ligands present at high concentrations? We used the fruit fly receptor dOr22a and a banana-like odor mixture as a model system. We show that an intermediate ligand at an intermediate concentration alone elicits the neuron's blend response, despite the presence of both weaker ligands at higher concentration, and of better ligands at lower concentration in the mixture. Because all of these components, when given alone, elicited significant responses, this reveals specific mixture processing already at the periphery. By measuring complete dose-response curves we show that these mixture effects can be fully explained by a model of syntopic interaction at a single-receptor binding site. Our data have important implications for how odor mixtures are processed in general, and what preprocessing occurs before the information reaches the brain.}

The olfactory code consists of combinatorial activation patterns across sensory neurons, thus its capacity exceeds the number of involved classes of sensory neurons by a manifold. Activation patterns are not static but vary over time, caused by the temporally complex response dynamics of the individual sensory neuron responses. We systematically analyzed the temporal dynamics of olfactory sensory neuron responses to a diverse set of odorants. We find that response dynamics depend on the combination of sensory neuron and odorant and that information about odorant identity can be extracted from the time course of the response. We also show that new response dynamics can arise when mixing two odorants. Our data show that temporal dynamics of odorant responses are able to significantly enhance the coding capacity of olfactory sensory systems.},

How internal states interact to alter sensorimotor processing and shape decisions such as food choice remains poorly understood. Here we use pan-neuronal volumetric activity imaging in the brain of Drosophila melanogaster to investigate the neuronal basis of internal state-dependent nutrient appetites. We created a functional atlas of the ventral fly brain and find that metabolic state shapes sensorimotor processing across large sections of the neuropil. By contrast, reproductive state acts locally to define how sensory information is translated into feeding motor output. These two states thus synergistically modulate protein-specific food intake and food choice. Finally, using a novel computational strategy, we identify driver lines that label neurons innervating state-modulated brain regions and show that the newly identified `borboleta' region is sufficient to direct food choice towards protein-rich food. We thus identify a generalizable principle by which distinct internal states are integrated to shape decision making and propose a strategy to uncover and functionally validate how internal states shape behaviour.},

We found specific activation of one area of the antennal lobe corresponding to inputs from a specific receptor. However, upon more detailed analysis, we discovered that an impurity of 0.0006\% ethyl acetate in a chemical sample of benzaldehyde-d5 was entirely responsible for a sizable odorant-evoked response in Drosophila melanogaster olfactory receptor cells expressing dOr42b. Without gas chromatographic purification within the experimental setup, this impurity would have created a difference in the responses of deuterated and nondeuterated benzaldehyde, suggesting that dOr42b be a vibration sensitive receptor, which we show here not to be the case. Our results point to a broad problem in the literature on use of non-GC-pure compounds to test receptor selectivity, and we suggest how the limitations can be overcome in future studies.},

Second-order projection neurons encode the angular position of a male by detecting inter-antennal differences in cVA concentration, which are amplified through contralateral inhibition. At the third circuit layer, we identify 47 cell types with diverse input-output connectivity. One population responds tonically to male flies, a second is tuned to olfactory looming, while a third integrates cVA and taste to coincidentally promote female mating.

Intracellularly stained uniglomerular projection neurons (uPN) were reconstructed, registered to the 3D honeybee standard brain atlas, and then used to derive the spatial properties and quantitative morphology of the neurons of both tracts. We evaluated putative synaptic contacts of projection neurons using confocal microscopy. Analysis of the patterns of axon terminals revealed a domain-like innervation within the mushroom body lip neuropil. Projection neurons of the lateral tract arborized more sparsely within the lips and exhibited fewer synaptic boutons, while medial tract neurons occupied broader regions in the mushroom body calyces and the protocerebral lobe. Our data show that uPNs from the medial and lateral tract innervate both the core and the cortex of the ipsilateral mushroom body lip but differ in their innervation patterns in these regions. In the mushroombody neuropil collar we found evidence for ALT boutons suggesting the collar as a multi modal input site including olfactory input similar to lip and basal ring. In addition, our data support the conclusion drawn in previous studies that reciprocal synapses exist between projection neurons, octopaminergic-, and GABAergic cells in the mushroom body calyces. For the first time, we found evidence for connections between both tracts within the antennal lobe.}
